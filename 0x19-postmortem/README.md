Post-mortem: Website Meltdown of June 18, 2024
Issue Summary:

On June 18, 2024, from 09:00 to 11:30 SAST, the main website experienced a significant downtime of 2 hours and 30 minutes. As a result, all users could not access the service, encountering a 502 bad error. 
Root Cause: This disruption was identified as a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer following a routine update.

Fix errors while you still can!

Timeline:

09:00 SAST: 🚨Monitoring Alert: "An increase in 502 errors has been detected." An important issue has been identified: "Hey, everything's on fire!".
09:05 SAST: 🕵️‍♂️ The engineer has verified the alert and confirmed that the website is currently inaccessible
09:10 SAST: 🏃‍♂️ The investigation starts with a focus on the health of the web server and the connectivity of the database.
09:20 SAST: 🤔 Assumption: It is assumed that the database is having a party. Reality: The database is functioning and operating properly.
09:30 SAST: 🔝 Escalation to the web infrastructure team.
09:45 SAST: 🔍 Web infrastructure team dives into Nginx configuration.
10:00 SAST: 🧠 Misleading path: "Is it a DDoS attack?" Checks show: Nope, no unusual traffic.
10:20 SAST: 🔦 Eureka! Nginx error logs reveal a configuration error.
10:30 SAST: 🚨 Root cause identified: Misconfiguration in Nginx load balancer.
11:00 SAST: 🛠️ Fixed Nginx configuration and redeployed. Holding our breath...
11:15 SAST: 🎉 Service is back! High-fives all around.
11:30 SAST: 📈 Post-incident monitoring shows normal traffic and error rates.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Following a routine update, a minor misconfiguration was introduced into the Nginx load balancer configuration file. A syntax error within the upstream server block resulted in the cessation of traffic redirection to the application servers by Nginx, consequently leading to a 502 error for all users.

Resolution: Upon inspecting the Nginx error logs, the syntax error in the configuration was identified and addressed. Following the correction, the Nginx service was redeployed, promptly restoring the website's functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements Needed:

Make the configuration review process tighter than your grandma’s purse.
Implement automated syntax checking for configuration files—robots don’t miss commas.
Enhance monitoring to catch these sneaky configuration issues faster than you can say “502.”
Specific Tasks:
Task 1: Enhance the Nginx server by implementing a pre-deployment syntax validation step to mitigate unexpected issues.
Task 2: Integrate automated tests for configuration changes into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure efficient deployment.
Task 3: Update monitoring systems to encompass checks for configuration errors, thereby augmenting the oversight of the system.
Task 4: Organize training sessions for engineers to educate them on best practices for Nginx configuration management, thus reducing the likelihood of future errors.
Task 5: Develop a contingency plan for configuration changes to swiftly revert to a known stable state in the event of errors, as a prudent measure.

By implementing these measures, we aim to preempt similar issues in the future and achieve a streamlined and resilient deployment process.
