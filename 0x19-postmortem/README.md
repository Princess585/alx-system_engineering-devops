Issue Summary:
On June 18, 2024, from 09:00 to 11:30 UTC, the main website experienced a significant downtime of 2 hours and 30 minutes. As a result, all users could not access the service, encountering a 502 bad error. 
Root Cause: This disruption was identified as a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer following a routine update.

Timeline:
09:00 UTC: An alert from the monitoring system identified an increase in 502 errors, indicating a potential issue that requires attention.
09:05 UTC: The engineer on duty confirms the alert and identifies the inaccessible website.
09:10 UTC: Initial investigation focuses on the web server's health and database connectivity.
09:20 UTC: Based on the assessment, it was presumed that the database could be experiencing an overload. However, the database logs indicate that there are no issues.
09:30 UTC: At 09:45 UTC, the web infrastructure team initiated an investigation into the Nginx configuration as a response to the incident.
10:00 UTC: The team did a thorough check for potential DDoS attacks, but found no irregular traffic patterns. 
10:20 UTC: Further analysis was conducted, leading to the discovery of configuration errors in the Nginx error logs.
10:30 UTC: the root cause of the issue was pinpointed as a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer.
11:00 UTC: After making necessary corrections to the Nginx configuration, the team redeployed at 11:00 UTC:
11:15 UTC: the service was confirmed to have been restored and was fully operational.
11:30 UTC: Post-incident monitoring showed that traffic and error rates had returned to normal.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: During a routine update, a misconfiguration was introduced in the Nginx load balancer configuration file. This misconfiguration caused Nginx to fail in directing traffic to the application servers, leading to a 502 error for all incoming requests.

Resolution: The error was identified in the Nginx error logs, which indicated a problem with the configuration file. The team corrected the syntax error in the configuration and redeployed the Nginx service. After ensuring the configuration was correct, the load balancer resumed normal operation, and the website became accessible again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements Needed:
Enhance the configuration review process to catch syntax errors before deployment.
Implement automated syntax checking for configuration files.
Improve monitoring and alerting to more quickly pinpoint configuration-related issues.
Specific Tasks:
Task 1: Patch the Nginx server to include a pre-deployment syntax validation step.
Task 2: Add automated tests for configuration changes in the CI/CD pipeline.
Task 3: Update monitoring systems to include checks for configuration errors.
Task 4: Conduct training sessions for engineers on best practices for Nginx configuration management.
Task 5: Create a rollback plan for configuration changes to quickly revert to a known good state in case of errors.
